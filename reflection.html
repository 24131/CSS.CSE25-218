    <h3>Embracing Growth: My Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>
      Transitioning into tertiary education has been both exciting and challenging. At first, I struggled with time management and adapting to the independence of college life. Deadlines felt overwhelming, and I often found myself procrastinating.

      Over time, I developed better routines—using planners, breaking tasks into smaller goals, and prioritizing effectively. I also learned to embrace a growth mindset. Instead of fearing failure, I began to see mistakes as opportunities to learn and improve.

      Group work played a major role in my development. I learned to communicate clearly, resolve conflicts respectfully, and appreciate diverse perspectives. These experiences taught me that collaboration is not just about dividing tasks—it's about building trust and growing together.

      Today, I feel more confident, focused, and open to feedback. My journey is far from over, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited for what’s ahead.
