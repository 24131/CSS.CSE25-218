Dear Sir/Madam,

RE: Application for Industrial Attachment

I am currently pursuing a Diploma in [Your Program] at [Your Institution] and seeking an industrial attachment to gain practical experience. I have developed skills in Microsoft Access, presentation design, and basic web development, and I am eager to contribute to your team.

Attached are my CV and academic transcript. I am particularly passionate about building user-friendly systems and applying business process analysis to solve real-world problems. I am confident that an attachment at your organization will not allow me to apply my skills but learn new skill in a practical environment while contributing meaningfully to your company.

 I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to the opportunity to learn and grow with your organization.Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Thabiso Blessing Masalila
